                  The objective of this project was to design a responsive website that showcases a well-curated design portfolio using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The website’s primary
                  target user consists of individuals from my professional network, recruitment agencies and potential employers. It was essential that, above all, the website is simple and straight-forward to use, and provides a high-performance
                  experience.
                </p>
                <p class="bolder">
                  It was also important that the website portrayed elements of my personality. I achieved this through the styling, as well as through the use of illustration, animation, and transition effects. In essence, I wanted the user to
                  understand that I possess a genuine <strong>curiosity and desire to play with design.</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="bolder">
                  Considering that this was my first time coding a website from the ground up, I experienced numerous challenges throughout the project. I was able to overcome these through much dedication, and an almost stubbornness to make my
                  vision a reality. I very much enjoyed pushing myself and experimenting, as each new challenge presented an opportunity to learn something new, and hence further develop my skills.
                </p>
                <p class="bolder">
                  In the end, I believe that I was able to achieve my goal of creating a polished and professional website that clearly demonstrates my skills as a designer. I most appreciated the freedom and flexibility provided by coding from
                  scratch to express myself and showcase my designs in the best light.
                </p>
                <p class="bolder">
                  Moreover, I have acquired a proficiency in building websites with frontend languages. This has provided me with a newfound understanding of the possibilities and limitations of the systems I work with, and, as a result, a new way
                  of thinking about how to work around such limitations.

                <p class="bolder">
                  For a professional UX/UI designer, it is essential to have a place to present examples of your work. An ideal option is to have a dedicated
                  portfolio website, as this allows you to present the work you’ve done, while also showcasing your hands-on technical skills. Having a website means that you’ll not only be judged by the projects you’re showing, but also, on the
                  quality of the website itself, thus it’s especially important for it to be of high quality.
                </p>
                <p class="bolder">
                  This means that the portfolio website should have a distinct design that demonstrates one’s unique style of work, as well as clean and well-written code. Moreover, it is important that the website is responsive and works across
                  all devices, considering that responsive design has become a basic requirement for most projects, and that many people access websites via their phones.

                <p class="bolder">
                  To create a responsive portfolio website that shows off my design skills in an impressive and impactful way that will appeal to hiring managers and recruiters. The site must feature key information about me as a designer, a way to
                  contact me, and detailed case study pages of some of the projects I’ve worked on. As well as representing my skills and personality in the best possible way, the site should also demonstrate my newly-found frontend development
                  skills.

                <h3>Initial Research</h3>
                <p class="bolder">
                  My design process began with some research to get the creative juices flowing and to discover common features and patterns implemented in other portfolio websites. A key pattern I noticed was that most portfolio websites display their
                  projects on their landing page.
                </p>
                <p class="bolder">
                  Following the initial research, I wrote down a few ideas and elements to include in my portfolio site:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li class="bolder">I’m a big fan of minimalist design and wanted to stick with a neutral palette to allow the design to shine through, and use one bright colour as a highlight.
                  </li>
                  <li class="bolder">I like a generous amount of white space and a full-width layout.</li>
                  <li class="bolder">I wanted my case studies to tell a story about my design process, rather than just be a gallery of random images without context.</li>
                  <li class="bolder">I wanted to use my own image in some way as a hero image to inject some personality into the website.</li>
                  <li class="bolder">I enjoy the experience of seeing animation as I scroll down a page.</li>
                  <li class="bolder">Responsiveness is important to me because I want mobile and to also have an optimal experience.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Idea generation</h3>
                <p class="bolder">
                  Following the research phase I began with brainstorming my own solutions with a pen and sketchbook. It was important for me to find an angle that represents my personality, and integrate that into my design.

                <h3>Designing my brand</h3>
                <p class="bolder">
                  To design my brand, I thought about the visual language that best describes who I am and that determines how others see me. I wanted to convey a clean, sleek, and minimal look and feel. I kept things quite simple and decided to create a
                  logo mark from my initials, using a minimal colour palette. I sketched some ideas and experimented with typography and letter arrangement before deciding on the final logo (which I drew in Adobe Illustrator).
                </p>
                <p class="bolder">
                  As part of my branding, I also wanted to design an avatar for my website that would need to represent me as a designer, while being unique and memorable. After countless hours of brainstorming and sketching I came up with a concept
                  that I was happy with.
                </p>

                <h3>Colour and typography</h3>
                <p class="bolder">
                  Next, I determined my brand colours and font. I chose neutral shades of black and greys, with a splash of bright green to be used as an accent colour.
                </p>
                <p class="bolder">
                  In terms of font, I opted to have two different font families – one for titles and navigation, and one for body copy. Both fonts are modern yet simplistic.
                </p>
                <p class="bolder">
                  <strong>Headings:</strong> Montserrat – chosen due to its friendly nature and universal appeal.
                </p>
                <p class="bolder">
                  <strong>Body:</strong> Rajdhani – chosen because I like the modularised nature of its letterforms. Moreover, the squared and condensed appearance of the letters may be interpreted as being technical or even futuristic. It also
                  provides a good contrast to Montserrat.
                </p>

                <h3>Layout and structure</h3>
                <p class="bolder">
                  Regarding the layout, I wanted to keep it as simple as possible so that nothing distracts the viewer from what matters most – my projects. I also wanted to showcase both my UX/UI work work separately from my graphic design work.
                </p>
                <p class="bolder">
                  In terms of the design of the case studies, I took great effort to ensure that each case study matched the look and feel of the project itself - for example if the project was bright and fun, I wanted to portray the case study in
                  the same light.

                <p class="bolder" style="padding-top:1em;">
                  Once I figured out the basic structure of the site, I started sketching out wireframes to plan out the layout of the site’s content across various
                  breakpoints (mobile, tablet and desktop views). This helped me visualise containers, rows, and columns. From there, I developed the HTML pages for my site, built a CSS stylesheet, applied some basic JavaScript to add interactive
                  elements that would improve the user experience of my site. Throughout the entire process, I followed a mobile-first approach and used media queries to define how content behaves across larger breakpoints.

                  works better for a number of reasons:

                  The About page is where I allowed myself to have fun and display my personality.
                </p>
                <p class="bolder">
                  When the page is first opened, users are greeted with a quote that summarizes my design philosophy. I also placed my full logo in the background. This section fades away as the user scrolls down to reveal a large image of my avatar
                  in the background. I use parallax scrolling here to add depth to the page and provide a more interesting and memorable browsing experience.
                </p>
                <p class="bolder">
                  When viewing the site on mobile (i.e. screens less than 640px) the large avatar image is not displayed since the effect is not the same on smaller screens.
                </p>

                <p class="bolder">
                  As users scroll down, my background story scrolls up over the large background avatar image. Clicking on the “View Resumé” button opens up my resumé in a new tab.
                </p>
                <p class="bolder">
                  Between each section, I use parallax effect to display a wallpaper that I created, which contains graphics of things that I believe represent who I am as a person - things I like and value. This wallpaper helps to add a touch of
                  personality to the site.
                </p>
                <p class="bolder mb-1">
                  On mobile and tablet however, the wallpaper is simply displayed as a static image since the background- attachment:fixed is not compatible on mobile.

                <p class="bolder">
                  I end the About page with a section that gives users a glimpse of my values and also provides insight into the graphics used in the wallpaper.
                </p>
                <p class="bolder">
                  I decided to relate the heading of the footer to the content of the page, hence the slightly different wording to that on the homepage.

                  <h3>Project page design</h3>
                  <p class="bolder">
                    Each project page was designed with the same styling and feel of the project itself.
                  </p>
                  <p class="bolder">
                    For projects with in-depth case studies, users are first provided with a summary page about the project, giving users just a taste of the project's keey highlights. Users can then decide if they want to learn more by clicking on
                    a link that takes them to the full case study.
                  </p>
                  <p class="bolder">
                    To create a more interactive experience and entice the user to want to view more, the summary pages have been designed so that the content fades in as users scroll down the page. A parsllax effect has also been applied in the hero
                    section on larger screen sizes.
                  </p>
                  <p class="bolder">
                    In the design of the detailed case study pages, I decided to have a navigation hides on scroll down, and gets revealed on scroll up. This pattern is considered particularly useful on mobile, where the header tends to take up a
                    significant portion of the smaller screen size. Therefore by hiding the header, there is more space to display the content.
                  </p>
                </div>
                <img class="sol_project_grid--item-2" src="img/personal_website/mp_summary_page.png" alt="MonstaPrusuit Project Summary Page Landing Sreen" />

                <p class="bolder">
                  The footer on each project page contains a link to contact me. I decided give the footer a darker background colour on these pages to provide higher contrast compared to the rest of the page. Again, the wording of the title is
                  slightly different to that on the Home and About pages.
