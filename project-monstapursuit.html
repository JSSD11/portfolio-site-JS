          <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
          <p>
            MonstaPursuit is a mobile app that turns your run into a game, where you must find and battle virtual monsters with exercise along your route. The app provides a new way to bring variety and fun into running, as well as providing a social
            platform to foster local fitness communities.

              <h2>CONTEXT</h2>
              <p>
                I designed MonstaPursuit as part of CareerFoundry’s UX Design course, where I was tasked to design a scavenger hunt mobile app. I decided to expand the concept and use it to turn a one-dimensional, individual workout, such as
                running,into a multi-dimensional, fun, and social experience.

          I implemented the design thinking process, starting with user research to gain an understanding of user needs and the problem space. This included, conducting competitive analyses, and facilitating user interviews and surveys. Next, I
          created user personas, task analyses, and user flows, which would become the foundation for the information architecture of the app. The ideation phase entailed the development of low- to mid-fidelity wireframes, which I used to turn into
          a clickable prototype. These were created using various design software, including Balsamiq, Sketch, and AdobeXD. With the interactive prototype ready, I then conducted usability tests to obtain feedback from potential users. Their
          feedback was essential in helping me make adjustments to the design and flow of the. I also consulted with colleagues regarding the visual design, whose suggestions were incorporated in the design.

            <h3>EXPLORING THE PROBLEM SPACE</h3>
            <p>
              I first needed to better understand the market in order to make more informed decisions about my strategy and initial minimum viable product (MVP). I started by looking at existing solutions of both fitness and scavenger hunt apps, since
              my app aimed to combine these two concepts. I was interested in how these apps build engagement and motivation through rewards and gamification, as well as how much emphasis they place on the social features.

              <li>Social features play an important role in motivation (e.g. connecting with like-minded people, peer-recognition, finding inspiration & new ideas), but not all respondents were keen to share their own results.</li>
              <li>What makes exercise a habit: routine; planning ahead; sense of accomplishment; seeing progress; goal setting; variety to prevent boredom and fitness plateau; the feel-good feeling after exercise.</li>

              After having determined the core features of the app, it was time to move on to the Information Architecure of the app and deetrmine how best to organize the app's content. To ensure the app is intuitive and easy to use, I conducted an online open card sorting exercise using optimal sort with 8 testers to help me understand how users conceptualize the content of the app so that I could ensure that the content was organized to match their mental models.

              The results of the card sort revealed the following key points:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>The 5 distinct categories established by the participants did not diverge too much from my original classifications.</li>
              <li>A novel concept (such as the running game app) makes grouping topics less instinctive , due to lack of familiarity, which leads to increased diversity in the results.</li>
              <li>Sample size is relatively small, thus results are not very strong.</li>

            <h3>PUTTING PEN TO PAPER</h3>
            <p>
              With the foundations hatched out, the next step was to draft out the core structure and navigation of the app. To do this efficiently and under time contraints, I used brainstorming techniques, such as 6-8-5 method (or crazy 8’s) to generate 6-8 ideas in 5 minutes. This allowed me to iterate through many design options quickly.
            </p>
            <p>
              The paper wireframes progressed from showing only basic content to displaying more detail in order to better understand the high-level functionality of the app.

            <h3>LEVELLING UP</h3>
            <p>
              To reduce points of friction and refine the user flow, I worked in iterative cycles based on feedback from my peers. Increasing the level of fidelity from low-fidelity paper sketches to mid-fidelity digital wireframes helped to improve the structure of the interface and discover inconsistencies in flow. These wireframes were created using Balsamiq.

              I refined the wireframes further to a higher-level version created using Adobe XD, paying attention to spacing, sizing of elements, and copy. With a set of polished, grayscale screens, I was able to put them together with click events and animation, making it interactive. I now had a clickable high-fidelity prototype of the app’s core features, ready for user testing.

            <p>
              I conducted moderated usability tests, 2 in person and 4 online, in which participants were asked to complete a set of scenario tasks. Each of the participants had some experience with running outdoors and using an app to track their runs. They had varied level of experience and fitness as I wanted to test the app on my target group. So my participants included committed runners with a regular training schedule, those who exercise as a social activity, and those new to running.
            </p>

              <li>The concept was well received and all participants were able to correctly describe the purpose of the app.</li>
              <li>Language choices are key. Copy needs to be clear and to the point.</li>
              <li>Use familiar design patterns wherever possible.</li>
              <li>Most of the confusion related to the task of creating a new Mission, due to  lack of familiarity with this process. However users noted that after doing it once, the next time it would be easier, signifying good learnability. </li>
              <li>Work needs to be done on navigation and discoverability.</li>
              <li>Testers all had similar issues and questions. </li>

              Following the usability tests, my focus shifted to polishing the visual design. It was important that I developed a vibrant and friendly visual language to activate the visceral experience level of emotional design.
            </p>
            <p>
              I incorporated the recommendations laid out in Human Interface Guidelines and chose colours and fonts considering psychology of colour and type. I also designed fun illustrations and incorporated animations to help boost engagement through positive stimuli. While shaping the app’s visual design I ensured adherence to WCAG, in particular with regards to colour contrast, font size, form fields, and icons and buttons.

              Providing a solution to motivate people to exercise outdoors was challenging yet fun. It took 8 iterations to get to the final solution. By analysing the design challenge through different angles and points of view, I was able to develop and iterate on my wireframes. I recognize that developing the app is a continuous process, which requires constant testing and feedback from users.

            <h3>NEXT STEPS</h3>
            <p>
              MonstaPursuit’s design has been validated through user testing, and the wireframes and style guide are ready to hand-off to developers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once the app is functional, I will continue to test its usability and make improvements where necessary. I will also explore opportunities to enhance the user experience and increase users’ engagement with the app, with features such as points, goal setting and rewards.
            </p>
            <p>
              A carefully planned points system in which users can progress up a scoreboard is expected to increase competition among users, helping to promote usage as friends try to out beat one another.
            </p>
            <p>
              Additionally, a rewards system tied to users’ goals can be implemented, whereby users receive extra points and/or coupons from industry partners as they progress further towards their goal. Points can also be exchanged for vouchers to be used in local health-related businesses. These rewards can help promote local start-ups in the health and fitness industry, and hence strengthen the community of like-minded individuals.
            </p>
            <p>
              By keeping users motivated to use the app, these features will help to build habit as users start feeling better and seeing progress as a result of consistent activity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, augmented reality features could be implemented to provide a more immersive user experience.
            </p>
            <h3>LEARNINGS</h3>
            <p>
              Working on this project allowed me to fully understand the importance of competitive analysis, comprehensive user research, and usability testing.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Competitive analysis ensures sound understanding of the market and existing solutions which helped me recognize successful practices, and, more importantly, areas with gaps in the market. I was able to focus on these as opportunities to develop a design further and hence provide an advantage for my users.</li>
                <li> 2. Extensive user research provided me with valuable knowledge about my users - who they are and what are their needs - which was essential for delivering a high quality design speecificallly targeted for them.</li>
                <li> 3. Usability testing prevented me from implementing inefficient solutions in thee final development stage, thereby saving time, effort, and resources put into future reworks.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              While the entire project was a learning experience, I particularly enjoyed listening and talking to users to connect with their motivations and needs to design solutions. It helped me to understand my strengths and weaknesses as a designer which I can now respectively hone and improve upon.
