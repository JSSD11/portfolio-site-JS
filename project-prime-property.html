          Real estate investment is an increasingly popular way for individuals to achieve financial security. It is an exciting and emotional experience, but often complicated. While there are plenty of blogs and agencies providing information, often, buyers new to the market may struggle to get started without professional guidance and waste time viewing properties out of their range. This web app will provide them with the expertise needed to get started efficiently.

              In order to build upon the user research data, I conducted a competitive analysis to better understand the current solutions available and assess how successful they were at addressing Rashida's needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              Having catalogued opportunity gaps in the market, it was time to shape a relevant solution. I started by creating a <strong>user flow diagram,</strong> which focuses on the <strong>specific actions the user must take</strong> while traversing the product in order to fulfill the goals outlined in the user stories. <strong>Contextualizing the user journey</strong> in this way allowed me to <strong>identify pain points</strong> early on, <strong>visualize the information architecture</strong> of the app, and ensure that the <strong>strategy was aligned to specific user goals and needs,</strong> thereby avoiding feature creep.

            <p>
              With the user flow diagram laid out, it was time to put pen to paper and hash out low-fidelity hand-drawn sketches. These allowed me to start working on the basic layout of each screen and outline, in slightly more detail, the steps alredy outlined in the user flow diagram. I made sure to keep the wireframes to a low level of detail, and simply test the interactions and overall structure of the ideas.
            </p>
            <p>
              After several iterations of sketching, I was ready to add interactivity to the design by connecting the wireframes together in a low-fidelity prototype. This is an essential step in the design process as it allowed me to test that the flows laid out in the wireframes actually work, before putting time and resources into the visual design of the app. The role of the low-fidelity prototype was to highlight only the high-level functionality of the design.

            <h3>Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</h3>
            <p>
              Once the  basic layout, navigational system, and high-level functionality of the app was ironed out, I created mid-fidelity wirframes, paying close attention to <strong>visual hierarchy and spacing.</strong> I also made sure to incorporate <strong>UI design patterns</strong> into the design, which are reusable design solutions to common UI problems. It is important to include these patterns as much as possible since they help to <strong>improve usabilitity</strong> and make the design more instinctive as users are able to much more easily use systems and functionality that they recognize or have encountered before.

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Onboarding:</strong> when new users sign up they are presented with a description of the main features and benefits the app has to offer.</li>
              <li><strong>Empty state screens:</strong> a common design pattern where  instructional information is displayed on empty screens, explaining how to use them and fill them with content.</li>
              <li><strong>Input Feedback:</strong> a design pattern that gives users feedback as they fill out a form in the form of a check mark for data entered correctly, and an exclamation mark with an error message for data entered incorrectly.</li>
              <li><strong>Hamburger menu:</strong> a well recognized icon  to represent the site’s navigation menu.</li>
              <li><strong>Modal windows:</strong> surfaces that display content temporarily while allowing users to go back to the content they were viewing previously. These are used to display confirmation messages, as well as when getting information from the user.</li>
              <li><strong>Search auto-complete:</strong> this pattern is used to provide users with search recommendations based on what they’ve typed so far, which helps to save time and provide insight into what search options are available.</li>
              <li><strong>Map view:</strong> the common patteern to allow users to search by location on a map.</li>

            <h3>Mood Board</h3>
            <p>
              Once the composition of the screens were developed. it was time to turn to the visual design of the app. The first step in this process was to <strong>establish the mood</strong> I wanted the app to evoke. This is best captured by creating a mood board that <strong>tells a strong story about the product and what I want users to feel</strong> while using the app.
            </p>
            <p>
              Two mood boards were created depicting current interior design trends. The first mood board provides a clean, minimalist, and contemporary feel, while the second conveys a more eclectic, and whimsical  energy.

              <h3>Decision: Mood Board # 1</h3>
              <div>
                <p>
                  I decided to go with the first mood board for the following reasons:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The minimalist style suggests that the UI will be clean and simple and thus will not distract from the content and functionality of the app. At its core, minimalism is function. No extras, No waste. This will therefore appeal to the user, Rashida, who is new to real estate and needs an app that is easy to use.</li>
                  <li>The monochromatic colour scheme evokes a professional and business-like impression, while the hint of gold adds sophistication and a high-end feel. This further aligns with the users’ objective of wanting to achieve financial security by investing in real estate.</li>
                  <li>The minimalism design trend of simplicity, clean lines, and lots of white space has been popular in architecture and interior since the 2010’s, nevertheless this trend has yet to catch on with real estate brands, which remain stodgy and dated. Having said that, there are a few that have recently rebranded, particularly those in the luxury market in New York, such as Century 21, Halstead, and Brown Harris Stevens. I therefore believe that creating a modern, yet timeless, feel to the web app will project a modern view, making it relevant to users like Rashida, who are always on top of the latest trends.</li>
                </ul>

            <h3 class="md-pt-1">Colour Scheme</h3>
            <p>
              After having established the vision and emotions I wanted the app to communicate, I was able to create the colour palette.
            </p>
            <p>
              I decided on a colour scheme that is chiefly monochromatic, consisting of 5 shades, including white and an off-black colour which is treated as the brand’s black colour. Black exudes a sophisticated and modern feel, while white evokes feelings of simplicity, elegance, and purity and helps to communicate a calm, uncomplicated, and professional atmosphere. In order to add contrast to this scheme, gold is used to act as a highlight colour. The gold colour is associated with tradition, affluence, and extravagance. These colours therefore work perfectly for a real estate app, particularly one intended for users wishing to buy property for investment.

            <p>
              When defining the typography of the app, careful attention was placed on key design considerations, not only to ensure copy is readable and easy to understand, but also in making sure the text is attractive and styled conistently with the mood board.
            </p>
            <p>
              Two different font types were chosen for the main text elements - headings and body copy.
            </p>
            <p class="large-font">
              Headings
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top:1em;">
              The sans-serif typeface <strong>Neue Haas Grotesk Pro</strong> was chosen for headings due to its <strong>lucid, clean, no-nonesense style</strong> that makes it very readable. Kerning, tracking, and leading were carefully considered with headings in order to achieve the spacious feel that adds to the premium and sophisticated look of the app. The idea was for headings to appear <strong>bold and strong, yet not condensed and over-bearing.</strong> Visual hierarchy was established through the use of different font sizes and weights.

            <p style="margin-top:1em;">
              The slab serif typeface <strong>Breton</strong> was chosen for body copy due to its strong personality, unique rhythm, and editorial look, which combines well with Neue Haas Grotesk. Similar spacing treatments are used for body copy as for headings, as well as a combination of different line weights and font sizes to establish visual hierarchy.

            <p>
              Just as with text, icons work as a language to communicate information to users (particulalry in mobile) - yet they also contribute significantly to the visual style of products. It was therefore important that the design of the icons remained functional while complimenting the minimalist and modern theme.
            </p>
            <p>
                In keeping with the spacious feel of the design, it was decided that line icons would be most appropriate (except when indicating a selected state). Additonally, the colour palette was kept simple (only 2 colours are used). In order to appear as part of a coherent set, icons needed to be designed with a consistent visual weight and dimension. Finally, icons were designed to be simple enough to ensure that clarity is retained at all sizes, while also displaying character, thereby adding to the overall design of the product.

              Illustrations are seen as a way to create a more engaging and unique experience. They help to establish authenticity to the design, enhance the brand identity, and drive it's character.  The illustrations used bend the rules slightly by pushing a more playful approach than that applied to icons, yet they still portray a simpleness in tune with the overall design. All illustartions are outlined by a stroke to bring to mind the icon design and they are composed of the brand's colours palette.

            <h3>Gestures</h3>
            <p>
              Gestures were incorporated into the design as a way to make the product more engaging and feel more intuitive to users, particularly when using the mobile product, as they provide a closer reepresentation of how users interact with the real world. Thus the project includes simple gestures such as tapping, swiping, and pinching. These can be seen in the final app prototype  in section 9 below.

            <h3 class="md-pt-1">Animation</h3>
            <p>
              Animation is used to provide basic transitions to gesture interactions, such as sliding and fading. These help to direct the user focus and lead them through the app.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to transitions, other simple animations have been incorporated that help to provide users with feedback, for example letting them know that they have successfully completed a task.  These animations enrich the exprience by adding to the fun factor of interacting with the app.
            </p>
            <p>

            <h3>Responsive Design</h3>
            <p>
              The project brief called for the design of a responsive web app, yet thus far I had been focusing on the mobile breakpoint as I was adopting a mobile-first approach. Making the design responsive means that the design should look good on multiple design interfaces. This is achieved by designing for mulitple breakpoints.
            </p>
            <p>
              The decison on which breakpoints to design for was made by considering the content, i.e. depending on where the mobile design started to break and look fragmented, incohesive, and inaccessible on larger breakpoints, as well as considering the most popular device sizes used. It was thus decided to have three different design breakpoints - one for mobile at 375px, one for portrait tablet at 768px, and one for large desktop at 1280px.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once the breakpoints were established the mobile wireframes were adapted for the tablet and desktop breakpoints. In doing so, I adopted the <strong>progressive enhancement</strong> approach, which involves providing users with only necessary content so that screens are not clogged up and users do not get overburdened with information, hence cognitive load is reduced.

            <h3>Key Learnings</h3>
            <p>
              This was a very enjoyable project to work on and I was particularly excited to create a real estate app with a modern feel and look. I approached this with the intent of helping my persona, Rashida, seamlessly find prospective proprties that she would be interested to invest in, all the while enjoying the process.
            </p>
            <p>
              I learned the importance of using common UI patterns as they are already tried and tested extensively and help significantly improve usability of the app since users would have previously encountered their functionality. Additionally, designing for multiple breakpoints enabled me to fully explore principles of responsive design, such as the importance of presenting users with the most convenient functionality and layout based on the device they’re using to view the site or app. This is particulalry pertinent when comparing mobile and desktop since users use different behaviour  and tools when communicating with these interfaces.
